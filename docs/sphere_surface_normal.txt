- Imagine a sphere and a tiny arrow sticking straight out(perpendicular) with respect to the point of intersection with the surface.

- The specified arrow is the surface normal in leyman terms.

- Why are surface normals important when it comes to shading?
- Surface normals tell us about which way the surface is facing.

- Should normals have random length or length = 1(unit length)?
- We choose unit length always, because we want to find the surface normal once and not everywhere.

- Finding the surface normal on a sphere is quite easy:
- we define it by:
-                  normal = (hit-point - center)
                           ----------------------
                                    radius

- Where center is the sphere center, hit-point is the ray hit-point and radius is the sphere radius.

- The normal vetor points directly outward from the sphere.
- normal = hit_point - center.
- To make it unit length, we do: 
-                  normal = (hit-point - center)
                           ----------------------
                                    radius
