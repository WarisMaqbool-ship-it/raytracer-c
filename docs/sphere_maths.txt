- The eq for a sphere of radius r cenetered at the origin is: x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = r^2
- As the general equation of a sphere is (x-h)^2 + (y-k)^2 + (z-l)^2 = r^2
- Where (h,k,l) is center and r is radius
- If the sphere is centered at (0,0,0), general eq = x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = r^2

- If we want the sphere center to be at an arbitarary point (Cx, Cy, Cz), then the general eq becomes:
                                 (Cx - x)^2 + (Cy - y)^2 + (Cz - z)^2 = r^2

- You might note that a vector from point P = (x, y, z) to center C = (Cx, Cy, Cz) = (C - P).

- If we use the definition of the dot product:
                 
                 (C-P).(C-P) = (Cx - x)^2 + (Cy - y)^2 + (Cz - z)^2 (Because dot product conveys that (A+B).(A+B) = A.A + A.B + B.A + B.B)

- Lets expand point p as our actual ray point as: P(t)

- This gives us: (C - P(t)).(C-P(t)) = r^2

- We know that P(t) = Q + td   (definition of a ray), so let's expand it:
               
                 (C - (Q+td)).(C - (Q+td)) = r^2

- We can also write it as under as we want to solve the t, so we will separate the terms based on whether there is a t or not:
            
                 (-td + (C-Q)).(-td + (C-Q)) = r^2

- And now by following the rules of vector algebra we get:
                 t^2.d - 2td.(C-Q)+(C-Q).(C-Q) = r^2

- Moving the square of the radius to the left hand side we get:
                 t^2.d - 2td.(C-Q)+(C-Q).(C-Q) - r^2 = 0

- For sharp eyed individuals, it is clear that the eq we are getting is a quadratic eq.

                               _____________________
- So we can solve it by :t = / -b +- / b^2 - 4ac

                                       2a
- For solving t in the ray sphere intersection equation gives us these values of a,b and c:
                             
                             a = d.d
                             b = -2d.(C-Q)
                             c = (C-Q).(C-Q)-r^2


- The square root can be either positive, negative or zero.
- Meaning that if square root is:
- Positive: meaning two real solution(ray is passing in through a point and leaving through other)
- Negative: ray never interferes with the sphere meaning no real solution
- Zero: ray hits the edge of the sphere meaning only one real solution
